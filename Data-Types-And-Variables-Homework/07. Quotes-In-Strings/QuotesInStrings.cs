//Problem 7. Quotes in Strings

// Declare two string variables and assign them with following value: The "use" of quotations causes difficulties.
// Do the above in two different ways - with and without using quoted strings.
// Print the variables to ensure that their value was correctly defined.


using System;

class QuotesInStrings
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // First solution: using a quoted string with escape sequence \":
        string quotation1 = "The \"use\" of quotations causes difficulties.";
        Console.WriteLine(quotation1);
        Console.WriteLine();

        // Second solution: using a @-quoted string:
        string quotation2 = @"The ""use"" of quotations causes difficulties."; 
        Console.WriteLine(quotation2);
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
