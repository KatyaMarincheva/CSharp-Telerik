// Problem 19.** Spiral Matrix

/*Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) 
 * and prints a matrix holding the numbers from 1 to n*n 
 * in the form of square spiral like in the examples below.

Examples:

n = 2   matrix      n = 3   matrix      n = 4   matrix
        1 2                 1 2 3               1  2  3  4
        4 3                 8 9 4               12 13 14 5
                            7 6 5               11 16 15 6
                                                10 9  8  7
