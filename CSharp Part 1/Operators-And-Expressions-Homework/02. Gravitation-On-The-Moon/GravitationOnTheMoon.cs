// Problem 2. Gravitation on the Moon

/* The gravitational field of the Moon is approximately 17% of that on the Earth.
 * Write a program that calculates the weight of a man on the moon by a given weight on the Earth.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * weight 	weight on the Moon
 * 86 	    14.62
 * 74.6 	12.682
 * 53.7 	9.129
