// Problem 18.* Trailing Zeroes in N!

/*  Write a program that calculates with how many zeroes the factorial of a given number n has at its end.
    Your program should work well for very big numbers, e.g. n=100000.

Examples:
n 	    trailing zeroes of n! 	explaination
10 	    2 	                    3628800
20 	    4 	                    2432902008176640000
100000 	24999 	                think why
